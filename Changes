0.43      2015-02-01 22:33:09-02:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Changes]

  - Deprecate the distribution, because JIRA's SOAP API is already

    invited to try the JIRA::REST module instead.

0.39      2012-07-31 09:25:36 America/Sao_Paulo

  - Revert the constructor change of 0.38 because it broke
    invokations when JIRA server's base URL had a path component.

  - Implemented an alternative invokation style based on named
    arguments passed via a hash-ref. This was suggested by Slaven
    Rezić. Thanks!

    by Dan Baber via
    https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=72470.

0.23    2009-12-12

  - Corrects the SOAP serialization of arrays to enable the use of
    the add*AttachmentsToIssue API methods. Thanks to Jon Connell
    who reported the problem.

  - Implements the methods attach_files_to_issue and
    attach_strings_to_issue to make it easier to attach things.

    argument. Thanks to Lance Selvidge for the suggestion.

0.22    2009-11-30

    [http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=52076] that

  - Converts the 'duedate' field from the ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
    into the JIRA required format (d/MMM/yy) in create_issue and
    progress_workflow_action_safely. This is necessary because
    while JIRA requires the later, it gives the former in
    getIssue. Thanks to Andrey Belous for alerting me about this.

  - Adds a perlcritic test and placates some of its criticisms.

0.19    2009-11-06

    easily grok the custom field values from an issue.

  - Refactors some code in a bunch of helper functions.

  - Implements many more online tests. There are 39 now.

  - Makes the POD tests disabled by default. They are meant to be
    used by the author only.

0.16  2009-10-04

  - Implements the method get_favourite_filters, which caches the
    user's favourite filters.

  - Casts automatically filter names into filter id in the
    arguments for getIssueCountForFilter, getIssuesFromFilter, and
    getIssuesFromFilterWithLimit.

  - These changes were inspired by Andrew Grangaard's example in
    http://www.lowlevelmanager.com/2009/09/access-jira-api-from-perl-with.html.
    Thanks!

0.15  2009-09-28
