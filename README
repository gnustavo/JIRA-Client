JIRA::Client - Extended interface to JIRA's SOAP API

JIRA is a proprietary bug tracking system from Atlassian
(http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/).

DEPRECATION WARNING: Please, before using this module consider using the
newer JIRA::REST because JIRA's SOAP API was deprecated on JIRA 6.0 and
won't be available anymore on JIRA 7.0.
